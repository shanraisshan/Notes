# Webhook
> A webhook is a way for one application to send real-time data to another application whenever a specific event occurs. Instead of your app continuously asking ("polling") SendGrid for updates, SendGrid can push data to your app when something happens ‚Äî like an email being delivered, opened, clicked, bounced, etc.

# Example

### Savyour

```
{
  order_id: 123,
  amount: 455
}
````

### Sendgrid
SendGrid uses webhooks to notify your server about email events. The specific webhook is called the Event Webhook.

üîÅ How it works:
- You provide a webhook URL (an API endpoint on your server) to SendGrid.
- SendGrid monitors your email activity.
- When an event occurs (e.g., email delivered, opened, clicked, bounced), it sends a POST request with event data to your webhook URL in JSON format.
- Your server receives this data and can log it, trigger workflows, update user status, etc.
