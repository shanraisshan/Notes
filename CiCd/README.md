    #Engineering Excellence
    location /engr-excellence/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8571/;  # Frontend on port 8571
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    # API route (if accessed via /api/)
    location /engr-excellence/api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8570/;  # Backend on port 8570
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

8. now allow server to communicate with github account, generate ssh on server and add to github
9. ```git clone git@github.com:shayangd/engr-excellence.git```
10. ```cd engr-excellence```
11. ```create 3 .env in root,frontend and backend (paste .env.server content in these .env)```
12. ```docker compose up --build```
13. ```docker compose up -d```  (docker will keep on running on background)

- localhost and 127.0.0.1 are essentially interchangeable for accessing the local machine, but localhost is a name, while 127.0.0.1 is the actual IP address.
- 0.0.0.0 is not an address you connect to; itâ€™s used by servers to bind to all interfaces. Connecting to 0.0.0.0 directly is invalid.
