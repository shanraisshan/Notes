# SOLID PRINCIPLES

## SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
every class should have only one responsibility
```Animal.class should not contain Car functions()```

## OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE
software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification - design by contract
```AreaCalculator.class should not calculate area of Shapes (Circle.class, Square.class) instead each class should calculate inside thier class```

## LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
```mother&child â€¢ bird!=dog, bird=eagle```

## INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use... no generalpurpose interface
```fly() method in Bird.interface should be move to FlyingBird.interface```

## DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE 
Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes
```Engine.Class should not be initialized inside Car.Class but instead it should be constructor injected```

### [Dependency Injection](/App/Android/Architecture/Pattern/Dependency)
DIP sets the guideline for creating loosely coupled systems using abstractions, while DI provides the means to implement this principle by injecting dependencies
