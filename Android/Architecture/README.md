and is described in detail in the
[architecture learning journey](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/main/docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md).

### Modularization
> Design Pattern (Module Pattern), Paradigm (Structured Programming)

The **Now in Android** app has been fully modularized and you can find the detailed guidance and
