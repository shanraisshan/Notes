#### Q: How does Claude Context compare to other coding tools like Serena, Context7, or DeepWiki?
A: Claude Context is specifically focused on codebase indexing and semantic search. Here's how we compare:
- **Serena** A comprehensive coding agent toolkit with language server integration and symbolic code understanding. Provides broader AI coding capabilities.
- **Context7** Focuses on providing up-to-date documentation and code examples to prevent "code hallucination" in LLMs. Targets documentation accuracy.
- **DeepWiki** Generates interactive documentation from GitHub repositories. Creates documentation from code.

Our focus: Making your entire codebase searchable and contextually available to AI assistants through efficient vector-based indexing and hybrid search.
