# PERCENTAGE
```
% = 1/100
```

### 50% of 80
```
result = 50% of 80 
result = (50/100) x 80
result = 40
```

### 40 is What% of 80
```
40 = result% of 80 
40 = (result/100) x 80
(40 x 100)/80 = result
50 = result
```

### 40 is 5% of What
```
40 = 5% of result 
40 = (5/100) x result
(40 x 100)/5 = result
800 = result
```

### Increase from 100 to 140, find % increase.
```
140-100 = 40          ■ [incr-actual = diff]
(40/100)x100 = 40%    ■ [diff/actual) x 100 = incr%]
```
# DISTANCE
distance formula, way point, mid point formula, haversine formula

### Distance between 2 points
![](https://github.com/shanraisshan/Notes/blob/main/Math/!/distance-1.png)
```
sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1))
```
